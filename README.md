# Question: How do you solve the "Lights Out" puzzle (grid toggle)? C# Summary

The provided C# console application is designed to solve the "Lights Out" puzzle, which is based on a 5x5 grid. The user is prompted to input the initial state of the grid, with each row entered as a sequence of five 0s or 1s, separated by a space. The application then calculates the solution to the puzzle using the `SolveLightsOut` function, which iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell is 'on' (represented by a 1), the `Toggle` function is called to switch the state of the cell and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors. The `Toggle` function uses bitwise XOR operation to flip the state of the cells. Once the solution is calculated, it is printed to the console in a grid format. The solution represents the sequence of cells that need to be toggled in the initial grid to solve the "Lights Out" puzzle.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a breadth-first search algorithm to solve the "Lights Out" puzzle, while the C# version uses a simple iterative approach. The Python version explores all possible combinations of light toggles and keeps track of the ones it has already visited to avoid unnecessary computation. It uses a queue to keep track of the grids to be processed and a set to keep track of the grids that have been visited. The C# version, on the other hand, simply toggles the lights in the same row and column as each light that is initially on.

In terms of language features, Python uses list comprehensions to create copies of the grid, which is a feature not available in C#. Python also uses the `deque` data structure from the `collections` module to efficiently append and pop elements from both ends of the queue. The `product` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible combinations of light toggles.

The `toggle` function in both versions is similar, but the Python version uses a loop over a list of tuples to iterate over the neighbors of a cell, while the C# version uses two nested loops. The Python version also uses the `^=` operator to toggle the state of a light, which is the same as the C# version.

The way user input is handled is also different. In the C# version, the user is prompted to enter each row of the grid one by one. In the Python version, the user is expected to enter the entire grid at once. The Python version uses list comprehension to convert the input into a 2D list.

Finally, the Python version uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported. This is a feature not available in C#.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the "Lights Out" puzzle compared to the C# version. 

In the C# version, the solution is calculated by toggling the lights in the same row and column as each light that is initially on. The `Toggle` function toggles a light and its neighbors. The `SolveLightsOut` function iterates over the grid and calls the `Toggle` function for each light that is initially on.

In the Java version, the solution is calculated by trying all possible combinations of pressing the lights in the first row (32 combinations for a 5x5 grid), and then pressing the lights in the remaining rows based on the state of the row above. The `press` function toggles a light and its neighbors. The `check` function checks if all lights in the last row are off. The main function iterates over all possible combinations and calls the `press` function for each light that needs to be pressed according to the combination. If the `check` function returns true for a combination, the function prints the solution and breaks the loop.

The Java version uses a `Scanner` to read the input from the console, while the C# version uses `Console.ReadLine`. The Java version uses a 2D array with an extra column to store the state of the grid, while the C# version uses a 2D array with the exact size of the grid. The Java version uses bitwise operations to generate the combinations and to toggle the lights, while the C# version uses arithmetic operations.

The Java version uses a `char` array to read the input line by line and then converts the characters to integers, while the C# version splits the input line into a string array and then parses the strings to integers. The Java version uses a `boolean` function to check if all lights are off, while the C# version does not have a similar function. The Java version prints the solution inside the main function, while the C# version prints the solution in a separate function.
